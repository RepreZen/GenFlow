# RealizationTree

## Description

**PLACEHOLDER**

This will test a realization whose property contains a tree of realizations, 
following references through two or more levels. 

For example, a single root-level realization should be able to specify that:

* **Root object** includes all properties. 
    * **Immediate children** (reference properties) include only reference properties 
   and key properties
        * **Grandchildren** include only key properties. (These are always primitive, 
    therefore the tree is pruned to a maximum of 3 levels.)
