_type: RealizationModel
_documentation: |
  This model includes a set of reusable LinkStrategy, PropertySetStrategy, and 
  RealizationStrategy definitions that collectively capture updated RAPID-ML logic
  for automatic linking and embedding:
  * Root objects have all properties.
  * References auto-linkable to an objectResource will include the auto-link, 
    along with key properties, if any.
  * Non-auto-linkable references will embed all properties.

  There are no collectionResource auto-links, as these are problematic for reasons
  previously documented. See the following issues:
  * https://modelsolv.atlassian.net/browse/ZEN-3978
  * https://modelsolv.atlassian.net/browse/ZEN-3863

  This set of rules and reusable components should represent the essential 
  functionality required for easily composable linking and embedding logic.

  (*Note* - This was previously our M1 goal, but the milestones needed to be 
  more granular, and it turns out that this goal requires advanced composition. 
  So it's more appropriate to think of this as a near-final goal.)
