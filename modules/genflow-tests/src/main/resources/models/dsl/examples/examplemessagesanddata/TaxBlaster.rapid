/* 
  This example demonstrates the different ways of adding example messages and example data to our models.
  Example messages/data serve to document what the data that is sent to/from the API will look like and can occur 
  in the following locations:
  
  * On a data structure defined in a dataModel (keyword = dataExample).
  * At the resource level using the 'example' and/or 'externalExample' keyword.
  * At the message level using the 'example' and/or 'externalExample' keyword.

  The 'example' keyword references message text included between ''' '''. 
  The 'externalExample' keyword references a local file that contains the message text.
  
  Example messages/data are also used by the Mock Service to provide a mock implementation of your API so it can 
  be tried out, and your design refined, without having to fully implement the API. The Mock Service has rules for how it 
  selects the example data it will use:
  
  * The Mock Service only implements responses so example messages for requests are ignored.
  * Examples are used in order of precedence: response > resource > dataModel 
  * If a method has more than one response the Mock Service implements the first and ignores the others.
  * If a response has more than one example or externalExample the MockService uses the first one and ignores the others.
  
  Example messages and data have been added to the code below. Try running the Mock Service for this model
  and executing the methods. See which example data is returned. Try commenting out examples at the different levels
  in order to see how the messages change when you exercise the mocked API using the Swagger UI view.
  
  Comments are used in the code to draw attention to the feature being demonstrated in this example.
