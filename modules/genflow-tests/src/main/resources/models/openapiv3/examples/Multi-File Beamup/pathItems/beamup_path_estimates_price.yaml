  # Note the use of a simplified name for the path item object.  
  # The actual URI, assigned by the top-level Swagger spec, is 
  # /estimates/price. But a JSON pointer to this would require a 
  # '~1' token to substitute for each forward slash, and % url 
  # encoding sequences for the curly braces.
  # 
  # The leading slash is required by Swagger, so a reference to 
  # this item will include a leading '~1'. But we can avoid 
  # further escape sequences by using a simplified name.

      summary: Price Estimates
      description: |
        The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range for each product 
        offered at a given location. The price estimate is provided as a formatted
        string with the full price range and the localized currency symbol.<br><br>
        The response also includes low and high estimates, and  the 
        [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code for situations 
        requiring currency conversion. When surge is active for a particular product, 
        its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the price estimate already 
        factors in this multiplier.
