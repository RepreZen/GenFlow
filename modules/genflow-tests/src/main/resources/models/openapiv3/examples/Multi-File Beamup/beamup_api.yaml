# Each Path Item Object describes a resource, containing a set of operations
# at a specified path.  The Path Item object can define parameters and 
# responses common all of its contained operations.
paths:

  # Note the use of the '~1' sequence at the beginning of the pathItem
  # name, in the last segment of the JSON Pointer. The JSON Pointer 
  # specification uses '~1' to indicate a literal forward slash. It 
  # needs this substitution token because forward slash has special 
  # meaning as a path separator in a JSON Pointer.
  # 
  # We have simplified the names of the Path Item Objects, but the 
  # leading slash is required by Swagger.
  /products:
    $ref: "pathItems/beamup_path_products.yaml#/paths/~1products"

  # Note that the actual path has multiple segments, but we  don't have to repeat 
  # all of that in the definition. We use a simple name (with the required leading 
  # slash), and reference it by its simple name.
