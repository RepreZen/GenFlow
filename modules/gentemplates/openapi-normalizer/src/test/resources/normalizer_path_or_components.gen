# The parameters object contains variables that are processed directly by the GenTemplate.
parameters: 
  # List of model object types to inline.
  # For v2 models, allowed values are PATH, DEFINITION, PARAMETER, and RESPONSE.
  # For v3 models, allowed values are PATH, SCHEMA, RESPONSE, PARAMETER, EXAMPLE,
  # REQUEST_BODY, HEADER, SECURITY_SCHEME, LINK, and CALLBACK.
  # In both cases, ALL means all of those; COMPONENTS means all but PATH; NONE means none of them.
  # Note that recursive objects cannot be fully inlined. Each explicit reference to such an
  # object will be inlined, but recursive references encocuntered during that inlining will be
  # retained as references, forcing the object to be retained in the normalized model.
  INLINE: #
    - "PARAMETER"
    - "RESPONSE"
  
  # List of model object types to retain. Allowed values are same as for INLINE.
  # As for INLINE, ALL means all types, and COMPONENTS means all but PATH.
  # PATH_OR_COMPONENT means PATH if the model has any paths, and COMPONENTS otherwise.
  # Note that any object for which there is a non-inlined reference will be retained regardless
  # of this setting. If you see retained objects that you didn't expect, you may have to adjust
  # your INLINE setting.
  RETAIN: "PATH_OR_COMPONENTS"
  
  # Files whose unreferenced objects are eligible for retention
  # ROOTS means the top-level file and files specified in ADDITIONAL_FILES.
  # ALL means ROOTS plus any file that is loaded to resolve references.
  RETENTION_SCOPE: "ALL"
  
  # List of additional files to be treated as top-level.
  # Each file is specifed as a URL; relative URLs are resolved relative to
  # the primary source model (NOT this GenTarget configuration file).
  ADDITIONAL_FILES: #
    []
  
  # List of hoisting operations to perform, including MEDIA_TYPE, PARAMETER, and SECURITY_REQUIREMENT.
  # ALL means all of the above; NONE means none of them.
  # This option applies only to v2 models
  HOIST: "ALL"
  
  # Rewrite 'simple refs' to full refs. E.g. '$ref: Pet' => '$ref: "#/definitions/Pet"'
  # This option applies only to v2 models.

  # How objects should be ordered in normalized model
  # AS_DECLARED means leave things as they are in the source model
  # SORTED means sort obects mostly alphabetically by name; see documentation for full details
  # Note: ordering is currently enforced only for the root-level file
  ORDERING: "SORTED"
  
  # Which aspects of the x-reprezen-normalization extension properties to retain in the generated spec. Choose from:
  # - ORDERING for data recorded to reconstruct AS_DECLARED ordering
  # - POINTER and FILE for data identifying definitions of certain objects
  # - TYPE_NAME for property names of defined schema definitions
  # - BAD_REF for information about unresolvable references
  # You may also specify ALL or NONE

  OUTPUTS: "BOTH"
  
  # In body parameters with x-examples vendor extension, convert non-text values into json-serialized text.
  # This overcomes a bug in SwaggerParser that requires these examples to be text.
